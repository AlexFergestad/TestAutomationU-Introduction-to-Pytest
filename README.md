// This is my work of completing the course "Introduction to Pytest" on Test Automation University

In this course I learned the fundamentals of pytest.
I learned: Writing Test Cases, Using parametrization, Unit Test Cases, Fixtures, Markers, Commands and Configs, Filtering Tests, API Testing, and UI Testing (My Favorite)

Thanks!
